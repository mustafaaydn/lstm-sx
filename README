We combine an LSTM neural network and the SARIMAX time series model in a joint manner through a unified state space representation. The state space is then solved with particle filtering for parameter estimation. The state vector is entirely comprised of parameters-to-be-estimated, which allows for a single pass solution (e.g., with Kalman/particle filtering) instead of numeric optimization methods with iterative solutions.
